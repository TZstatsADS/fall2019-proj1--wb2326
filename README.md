### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: What Song Lyrics Tell Us About? 
+ This project is conducted by [Weijia Bao]

+ Project summary: In this project, I explore the texts from lyrics, a corpus of over 380,000 lyrics form MetrolLyrics. I wanted to find out what genre and what artist are most productive. Does their productivity decay or increase as time goes by? Do Rockstars complain more or instruct more? How about Rapstars? If complaining, what do they hate?
